## Business Understanding

> ### Stakeholder and Key Business Questions
>> *  #### Stakeholder: 
>>> Microsoft (Head of the new movie studio)   
>> * #### Key Business Questions: 
>>>  Microsoft has decided to venture into the film industry by creating a new movie studio.  However, they lack prior experience in movie production. This project aims to leverage data analysis to provide valuable insights that can inform their content creation strategy. The key question we will address is: 
>>> 1. Year-wise Performance for Domestic Gross and Foreign gross. 
>>> 2. Is there a strong correlation between a movie's budget and its box office performance? Understanding this relationship can inform budget allocation strategies for different movie types.
>>> 3. Can you identify any patterns between movie genres, budgets, and profitability (box office gross minus budget)? Profitability analysis goes beyond just box office and helps assess the financial viability of different movie concepts.
>>> 4. What is the top 10 movies from gross earnings to check if the movies trending in domestic gross are the same in worldwide gross.  
>>> 5. What is the distribution of release years for all the movies in the dataset?
